# blinky-from-scratch

The project aims to develop a minimal blinky code without the use of any IDE. 

why you ask ? to learn the details of what steps goes into compiling and flashing my code.

what will i use ? just a good old text editior, gcc compiler to genereate the output code 

and openocd to program the STM32F746 board link:https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases
